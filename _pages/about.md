I am a third-year PhD candidate working under the guidance of [Prof. Vireshwar Kumar](https://homecse.iitd.ac.in/team/vireshwar-kumar/) at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi](https://www.iitd.ac.in/). My research focuses network security concerning next-generation cellular systems. You can find my complete curriculum vitae [here](/cv).

<!-- I've had the opportunity to work in the Internet-of-Things domain at the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad. Prior to that, I honed my teaching skills as an Assistant Professor at ABES Engineering College, Ghaziabad, for over two years. I earned my master's degree in Information Security from the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Gwalior, in 2019. My academic foundation was laid with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Delhi. -->
About a decade ago, I wanted to come up with an online identity/pseudonym that I could use everywhere. I came up with _boardslayer_ because it combined two of my favourite things, boardgames and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. You can find me with that on most social media platforms.
