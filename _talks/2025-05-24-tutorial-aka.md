We conducted a tutorial session discussing 5G deployments and the steps the Core Network, Radio Access Network, and User Equipment take for mutual authentication.

The participants installed Docker Desktop on their desktops to run a simulated 5G network. You can find the steps to follow on the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/priyanshs/innog-demo), and you can follow the presentation from [this link](https://drive.proton.me/urls/FN78HHDY3W#pRNJF8nNX7z6).
