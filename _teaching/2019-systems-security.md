## Introduction

While I was teaching at ABES Engineering College, I was tasked to teach computer security basics to sophomore students in the Bachelor's of Technology (B.E.) domain . The course was conducted as a complement with the online MOOCs course offered by E&ICT Academy, IIT Kanpur. During the classroom hours the students and I discussed the fundamental concepts of Cyber Security and Cyber Defense. The discussions varied from the essential case studies to topical cyber attacks.

The socratic discussions was supported with reading material, at-home tests and tutorials. The [drive link](https://drive.proton.me/urls/VJYJTNHZYM#uvwPakNSFDIQ) contains all the material I compiled for the course along with tests that I contributed to.

I hope this helps the people looking for a better understanding of the fundamentals. You may connect with me if you require any help with the material.
