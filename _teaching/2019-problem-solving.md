This repository contains the course material from Problem Solving with Python, a programming course taught at ABES Engineering College, Ghaziabad, India. The coursework is designed by [Mr Ajit Shukla](https://www.abes.ac.in/teachers/mr-ajit-shukla/), [Ms Priyanka Gupta](https://www.abes.ac.in/teachers/ms-priyanka-gupta/), and [Mr Priyansh](https://priyanshs.github.io/).

The first ten to twelve hours are dedicated to familiarizing the student with the concepts of Python language along with various constructs. Afterwards, the course focuses on building problem-solving skills used in competitive programming. Lecture slides, the problem sets, and other supporting material can be found on this page.
